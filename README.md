I developed a Python script to simulate various models using full-state feedback and a Kalman filter. The models, along with the equation derivations, are detailed in the accompanying PDF file.

There are six of them:
- inverted pendulum on wheel (aka balancing robot)
- reaction on inverted pendulum
- inverted pendulum on cart
- double inverted pendulum on cart
- ball on beam
- control moment gyroscope

Control Systems Library is required to run the code.
